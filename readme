# IllustratorEventManager

I developed Extension to managemnt event on Illustrator like Photoshop script event manager.
I refered to Photoshop event manager. so this is similar with it.
but Illustrator doen't have event system like Photoshop.
so I use AIHostAdapter plugin. [you can get from here](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/CEP_11.x/AIHostAdapter)

## How install it

first you need AIHostAdapter plugin.
if you don't have, get it and save in plugin folder

on Mac OS directory is like this
application -> Illustrator folder -> plugin

and install this Extension zxp or clone git.

## How to use it

it almost same with Photoshop script event manager.
select event , and action or script , and register it.
push the dispatch button , it watches your activity and detective event you chose.

1. **preset**
you can save preset you registered. and you can load it later.

2. **events**
plugin has tons of events. but actually I don't grasp all of events. but you can see how each event work [here](https://gist.github.com/tokyosheep/b5d6aa71821138c2d788258e0758c821)

as I said still I don't grasp all of events so before use it , so I suggest testing before use for your work.
I can't guarantee to works accurately.
